    <h1 class="text-center">Space Tourism</h1>
    <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Space tourism refers to commercial space travel for recreational, leisure, or adventure purposes. It involves sending non-professional astronauts—ordinary people—into space for short-duration trips. These journeys can range from suborbital flights, which briefly enter space, to longer orbital missions and potentially even stays at space hotels in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Types of Space Tourism</h2>

        </h1>
        <h3 class="text-center">Suborbital Flights</h3>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite" >These flights take passengers to the edge of space, approximately 100 km above Earth, crossing the Kármán line, the boundary of space.
        Passengers experience a few minutes of weightlessness and breathtaking views of Earth.</p>
        Companies offering suborbital flights:
        Blue Origin's New Shepard
        Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo
        Orbital Flights</p>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Orbital tourism involves traveling into Earth's orbit, typically at altitudes of 400 km, where passengers stay for days.
        The experience includes living in zero gravity, observing Earth from space, and potentially visiting the International Space Station (ISS).
        Currently, these flights are rare due to high costs, with companies like SpaceX planning missions.
        Lunar Tourism (Future Vision)</p>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Emerging concepts involve tourists flying around the Moon or landing on its surface.
        SpaceX's Starship has been proposed for lunar missions, such as the dearMoon project, which aims to send artists and civilians on a journey around the Moon.
        Key Players in Space Tourism
        Blue Origin</p>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Founded by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft has successfully flown paying customers to the edge of space, offering panoramic views and weightlessness.
        Virgin Galactic Led by Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic focuses on suborbital flights aboard its SpaceShipTwo, promising a luxurious space experience.
        SpaceX. SpaceX has ambitious plans for orbital tourism using its Crew Dragon spacecraft and eventually its fully reusable Starship for Moon and Mars trips.
        Axiom Space</p>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Working on creating the first commercial space station, Axiom aims to provide orbital tourism and research opportunities.
        Notable Space Tourists</p>
        <h4 class="text-center">Dennis Tito</h4>
        <h1 class="text-center">

        </h1>
         <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">The first private individual to visit the ISS in 2001, paving the way for orbital tourism.Dentis Tito likely refers to Tito Albino, a prominent figure in dental office management. He is a member of the American Association of Dental Office Management (AADOM) and has been recognized for his excellence in the field. Tito has shared his inspiring journey from humble beginnings to becoming a successful office manager and regional manager overseeing multiple dental practices. His story emphasizes the importance of mentorship, community support, and personal growth within the dental profession.</p>
        <h4 class="text-center">Challenges in Space Tourism</h4>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Space tourism remains extremely expensive, with tickets costing between $250,000 (suborbital flights) and tens of millions (orbital flights).
        Safety Concerns</p>
        
        <p class="p-2" style="color:antiquewhite">Ensuring the safety of non-professional astronauts in the harsh environment of space is a critical focus.
        Environmental Impact
        
        Rocket launches contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, raising concerns about their environmental footprint.
        Physical and Psychological Fitness
        
        Travelers must endure G-forces, microgravity, and confinement in small spaces, which can be physically and mentally demanding.
        Future of Space Tourism
        Space Hotels
        
        Companies like Orbital Assembly Corporation are planning the first space hotels, offering extended stays in low Earth orbit.
        Lower Costs
        
        With advancements in reusable rockets, the cost of space travel is expected to decrease, making it more accessible to a wider audience.
        Deep Space Adventures
        
        Future missions could include visiting Mars or other celestial bodies as technology advances.
        Educational and Research Opportunities
        
        Space tourism is likely to inspire innovation and education in STEM fields, encouraging the next generation to dream of the stars.
        Space tourism represents humanity’s growing ability to explore the cosmos, not just for scientific purposes but as a life-changing personal experience. With continued investment and innovation, space may soon become a destination for everyone.</p><br><br>        <h6 class="text-center">Follow Daily Space for more updates</h6>
